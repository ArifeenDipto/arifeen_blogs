# Introduction

This post assumes that readers are already familiar with the concepts of **eigenvalues**, **eigenvectors**, **eigen decomposition**, **singular value decomposition (SVD)**, **matrix norms**, **four fundamental spaces (row, column, null and left null) of a matrix**,**correlation**, **mean**, and **variance**. Although these topics are briefly discussed here, having a solid understanding of them will help you follow the explanations more clearly.


# Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

Letâ€™s say we have a vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 1}$. When we multiply this vector by a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$, the resultannt vector $Av$ may change the **direction**, the **length (norm)**, or both.

- If $A$ is an **orthogonal matrix**, the length of $v$ is preserved, but the direction may change (like a rotation or reflection).  
- However, if there exists a nonzero vector $v$ such that $Av$ points in the **same direction** as $v$ (possibly scaled), then $v$ is called an **eigenvector** of $A$.

Formally, eigenvectors and eigenvalues satisfy:

$$
Av = \lambda v
$$

where:
- $v \neq 0$ is the **eigenvector**,  
- $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is the corresponding **eigenvalue**.

Lets see an example a matrix and its **eigenvectors**. 
# Example: Eigen Decomposition

Given the matrix:

$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -1 & 0 \\
-1 & 2 & -1 \\
0 & -1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The eigenvectors are:

$$
V =
\begin{bmatrix}
-0.5774 & -0.7071 & 0.4082 \\
-0.5774 &  0.0000 & -0.8165 \\
-0.5774 &  0.7071 & 0.4082
\end{bmatrix}
$$

And the eigenvalue matrix is:

$$
\Lambda =
\begin{bmatrix}
0.0000 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1.0000 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 3.0000
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Welcome to my mathematics blog! Let me test our mathematical rendering capabilities.

## Mathematical Expressions

Here's the famous mass-energy equivalence: $E = mc^2$

And here's the beautiful Euler's identity:

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

## The Quadratic Formula

The solution to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

## Calculus

The fundamental theorem of calculus:

$$\int_a^b f'(x) \, dx = f(b) - f(a)$$

Stay tuned for more mathematical explorations!

Welcome to my mathematics blog! Here I'll be sharing interesting mathematical concepts, proofs, and applications.

## What You Can Expect

This blog will cover topics including:
- Calculus and Analysis
- Linear Algebra
- Number Theory
- Mathematical Proofs
- Applications in Science and Engineering

## Testing Math Rendering

Let's test our MathJax setup with some beautiful mathematics!

### Inline Math
The famous equation $E = mc^2$ shows the mass-energy equivalence.

### Display Math
The fundamental theorem of calculus states:

$$\int_a^b f'(x) \, dx = f(b) - f(a)$$

### More Complex Examples

The solution to the harmonic oscillator:

$$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \omega^2 x = 0$$

has the general solution:

$$x(t) = A\cos(\omega t + \phi)$$

### Beautiful Integrals

One of the most beautiful results in mathematics:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$

### Matrix Operations

For matrices $A$ and $B$:

$$\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
e & f \\
g & h
\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
ae + bg & af + bh \\
ce + dg & cf + dh
\end{pmatrix}$$

Stay tuned for more mathematical adventures!
